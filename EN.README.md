This is an inventory planning calculator implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to calculate various inventory-related parameters based on input values such as demand, production rate, unit production cost, setup cost, and holding percentage. The calculator provides insights into the economic production quantity (EPQ), optimal production time, optimal inventory cycle time, and total cost.
